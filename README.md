# My Datapack Stuff

This is a repository containing all of the coding behind my datapacks, listed above.  These datapacks were created using a Dart framework called objD.  objD was created in mind to be a faster and more readable way to code datapacks.  At first it was way more confusing because I'd never used Dart before, but it's a very powerful tool, and I will continue to use dart for this project, and possibly more.
